Title: Personal Website
---

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

The main purpose of this site is to serve as a curated version of my (messy) PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) system.
The content is generated from my [Obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/), which is a collection of notes, articles, and
other resources that I find useful.

The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the custom domain name is registered with
[eu.org](https://www.eu.org/) for free.

DNS is managed by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) free plan.

The source code for this site is available on [GitHub]().

The design is minimalistic and inspired by various other personal websites and simple HTML pages I found online:

- [Perfect Motherfucking Website](https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/)
- [VimHelp](https://vimhelp.org/)
- [Nih.ar](https://nih.ar)
- [ig.emnace](https://ig.emnace.org/index.html)
- [Cole roberts dev](https://coleroberts.dev/index)
